    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>Ecma International's prototype-based programming language corresponds to a scripting language. 
        All web browsers have a built-in interpreter unless it's for a special purpose. 
        Today, it is one of the components of the web along with HTML and CSS. 
        If HTML is responsible for the basic structure of web pages and CSS is responsible for the design, JavaScript is responsible for the operation of web pages at the client end.

    <p><strong>To compare a web page to a car, HTML can be seen as the skeleton of a car, CSS can be seen as the exterior of a car, and JavaScript can be seen as the engine that is the power source of the car.</strong></p>
