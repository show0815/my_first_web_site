    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p><strong>A style sheet language that determines how documents written in markup languages such as HTML are actually represented on a website.</strong>

        CSS's C stands for Cascading because the way it inherits the style attributes of the higher element to the descendants resembles a waterfall in the DOM tree structure. 
        However, as an exception, attributes related to box models such as margins, padding, and border are not inherited. 
        Of course, you can force inherit it by giving it an inherit value.
